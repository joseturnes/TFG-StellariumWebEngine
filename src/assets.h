 *
 * All assets are uniquely identified by a url, that can be either:
 * - A url to an online resource (https://something).
 * - A bundled data url (asset://something).
 * - A local filesytem path (/path/to/something).
 *
 * The function <asset_get_data> return the data associated with an url
 * if available, and the function <asset_release> is a hint to the assets
 * manager that we won't need this asset anymore.

 * Enum: ASSET_FLAGS

 *   ASSET_DELAY        - Delay the network request for a few seconds.  This
 *                        is useful to prevent loading tiles resources too
 *                        quickly.
 *   ASSET_ACCEPT_404   - Do not log error on a 404 return.
 *   ASSET_USED_ONCE    - Hint that the data can be release after it has
 *                        been read.

 * Function: asset_get_data
 * Get the data associated with an asset url.
 *
 * This is non blocking.  If the asset is an online resource, then the
 * function returns NULL, set the return code to zero, and will need to be
 * called again in the future.
 *
 * The data returned is owned by the asset manager and so should not be
 * directly freed by the caller function (instead we can use <asset_release> to
 * notify that we won't need this asset anymore).
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   url    - url to an asset.
 *   size   - get the size of the returned data.  Can be NULL.
 *   code   - get the return code of the request.  For http assets this
 *            is set to the http return code, for other requests the code
 *            is set to either 200 or 404.  If the requests hasn't completed
 *            yet, the value is set to 0.
 *
 * Return:
 *   A pointer to the asset data, or NULL in case of error or if the data
 *   is not available yet.  To distinguish between error and loading, we
 *   have to check the code value.
